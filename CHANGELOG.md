# Kloudy's FH6 Painter Changelog

## 3.1.7
- Added normalized FH4 online live import and export with the same cross-game JSON shape identities used by FH5, FH6, and FM8.
- Added a dedicated non-supporter Support tab with clearer one-time-purchase benefits, complete offline library workflow details, and automatic hiding after a supporter key activates.
- Removed the repeating top-right supporter advertisement so the Support tab is the single unobtrusive place for supporter information.

## 3.1.6
- Added append-only, content-aware backups of the complete `imgs` folder with a remembered destination and background progress.
- Made large Outputs libraries substantially more responsive when browsing folders and selecting, cutting, or moving hundreds of JSONs.
- Preserved cached thumbnails when JSONs are moved or copied so file management no longer triggers unnecessary preview regeneration.

## 3.1.5
- Rebuilt Outputs as a source-scoped file browser with back, forward, parent-folder, nested-folder jump, search, folder creation, renaming, copying, moving, pasting, and permanent deletion.
- Added File Explorer-style selection for JSONs and folders: single-click selection, Ctrl toggles, Shift ranges, Ctrl+A, keyboard file operations, and selection-aware right-click actions.
- Kept generated, editor, game-export, and Library storage boundaries protected while allowing folders and JSONs to share the same visible name safely.

## 3.1.4
- Fixed the calibrated FH6 live group locator rejecting valid modern shape IDs and translucent layers after it had already found the correct RTTI group.
- Replaced oversized fallback memory scans with exact active-vector validation while retaining count, table, pointer, transform, and mask safety checks.

## 3.1.3
- Rebuilt the Editor page as a searchable project manager with asynchronous previews, clear service status, direct blank-canvas and JSON workflows, and first-run tutorial controls.
- Reorganized the manual editor around a complete tool rail, persistent Layers and Inspector workspace, precise selection and arrangement commands, visible history, recovery, reference images, guides, masks, text, pixel art, and export checks.
- Separated editable projects, temporary recovery, and portable JSON exports with atomic writes, duplicate-name protection, unsaved-work confirmation, serialized preview rendering, and safer local editor endpoints.
- Expanded the in-editor tutorial, Help topics, user manual, editor manual, and automated coverage for project handling, local service security, responsive layout, and editor interaction contracts.

## 3.1.2
- Added a dedicated eight-slot Featured gallery before Browse in the Community Hub, with curated artwork removed from ordinary discovery views while remaining available in personal views.
- Made featured supporter thumbnails visible to everyone with a clear supporter badge and a friendly Ko-fi prompt for locked downloads, while retaining verified access for full previews and JSON files.
- Added live Featured slot tracking and an enforced eight-artwork limit to the moderation panel, plus scope-aware catalog caching so the complete gallery restores immediately on later launches.

## 3.1.1
- Fixed local Forza mask decoding so terminal and nested mask markers render correctly without hiding ordinary colored shapes.
- Made Regenerate Local Thumbnails replace every managed preview across Generated, Editor, Game Export, and Library sources, retain those replacements after restart, and invalidate caches by renderer content instead of file timestamps.
- Fixed the 300-layer editor GPU handoff so source overlays keep their orientation, saved project layer IDs cannot collide during duplication, and rapid duplicate, undo, and redo commands execute in order without losing layers.

## 3.1.0
- Upgraded the manual vinyl editor for responsive work at the full 3,000-layer FH6 limit with indexed canvas state, bounded parallel resource loading, reusable caches, and a virtualized searchable layer browser.
- Added a transient GPU interaction renderer for smooth pan, zoom, transforms, masks, and source overlays while retaining the exact Fabric render after each interaction settles.
- Reworked editor history and autosave around shared unchanged layers, differential object restoration, deferred writes, stable editor IDs, and faster bulk selection, replacement, grouping, and layer-order operations.
- Enforced the 3,000-layer maximum across imports and creation tools, completed all 40 upper-letter resource slots, preserved editable project metadata, and kept exported FH6 JSON free of editor-only fields.
- Added repeatable 3,000-layer performance, project/export compatibility, mask, fallback-renderer, autosave, history, interaction, responsive-layout, and layer-order regression coverage.
- Prevented Git-checkout updates from deleting ignored local state such as worker dependencies, Wrangler databases, `.dev.vars` secrets, local virtual environments, previews, or rollback files, and made file verification independent of the optional `Get-FileHash` PowerShell command.

## 3.0.100
- Replaced the rate-limited GitHub API update check with cache-busted raw version checks, visible connection status, five-minute polling, and patch notes refreshed directly from GitHub.
- Made forced local thumbnail regeneration survive app restarts by preferring the newest valid managed or adjacent preview while preserving newer personal PNG overrides.

## 3.0.99
- Allowed Community Library downloads to use live online import while keeping scanned game-save library items protected as already present in the game.

## 3.0.98
- Replaced the manual UI scale multiplier with native Windows DPI scaling, a freely resizable frameless window, compact responsive layouts down to 960x600, and saved normal/maximized window geometry.
- Made Regenerate Local Thumbnails force-render every browser-visible local JSON without the normal background item or time limits, replace KFPS-managed previews, preserve personal adjacent PNGs, and report partial failures accurately.
- Saved the latest validated FH6 RTTI registry during normal app startup so live importing can reuse it offline without replacing the last good cache after a failed network refresh.

## 3.0.97
- Connected live FH6 locator updates to the Cloudflare registry used by trusted calibrators, while retaining GitHub and every existing cached, packaged, built-in, and live-search fallback.
- Made registry-source changes refresh immediately so an older GitHub cache cannot delay a newly calibrated game build after updating KFPS.

## 3.0.96
- Added a yellow MASKS identifier to Community artwork tiles, derived from validated shape data so existing and future masked vinyls are labeled automatically.
- Added Regenerate Local Thumbnails to Settings, which safely clears the dedicated runtime thumbnail cache, reindexes every local output source, and rebuilds previews in a low-priority worker without changing artwork or JSON files.

## 3.0.95
- Rendered Forza mask layers as ordered cutouts in Outputs, Community uploads, and editor-browser thumbnails while preserving detail layers placed above each mask.
- Kept mask-free preview rendering byte-for-byte compatible with the previous renderer and added focused coverage for legacy mask flags, transparent output, checkerboards, artwork bounds, and layer order.
- Versioned Community preview and thumbnail URLs by their verified hashes so regenerated server assets replace stale cached images immediately.

## 3.0.94
- Added the public Night City 2077 theme for supporters and non-supporters, with original angular controls, packaged Rajdhani typography, saturated red/cyan signals, layered depth, scrolling glyph rails, restrained glitches, and custom page transitions.
- Added theme-owned popup, field, navigation, scrollbar, tooltip, and interaction treatments with clipped glow and readable 105% text while preserving reduced-motion, ambient-motion, and effects preferences.

- This avoids stale raw-CDN version text immediately after pushes.

## 1.10.61

- Launcher GitHub checks now read from `refs/heads/main` so version and changelog checks avoid stale raw `main` aliases.

## 1.10.60

- GitHub version and changelog checks now use cache-busted raw URLs so the launcher sees fresh `main` updates more reliably.

## 1.10.59

- Launcher changelog now loads update notes from GitHub `main` instead of reading local updater log files.
